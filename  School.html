    <h3> Schools I was in </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Farouk </li>
          <ul>
            This is the my first school I attended. I do not remmber much except that I hated it.
          </ul>
        <li> <a href="http://www.bedayia.com/Default.aspx">Bedayia</a> </li>
          <ul>
            This is a school owned by my mother's familly. I love this school, i have made friends with a lot of people in it.
          </ul>
        <li> do not remmber </li>
          <ul>
            I do not remmeber the name right now, I could ask my sisters, but they are sleeping. This shows how shity it was. We just have came to Canada and we needed to enter a welcome class in french, becouse you cannot enter public english. I was learning quickly, but I faced some diffculities in Math, at the end i left middle of the year, and the techer begged dad for me to stay.
          </ul>
            <li> <a href="https://www.kuperacademy.ca"> Kuper Academy</a> </li>
          <ul>
            It was a good educational school, but i found it diffcuilt to find friends espically after I joined in the middle of the year. It was a private school.
          </ul>
        <li> <a href="https://www.ottawaislamicschool.org">Ottawa Islamic School</a> </li>
              <ul>
              Islamic, but they gave you free marks, people cheated and many were idiots. I hated this school. Eventhough i got an average of 95
              </ul>
        <li> <a href="http://isnaschools.com/high-school/">ISNA Highschool</a> </li>
               <ul>
                Favourite School in Canada, but not better than bedayia. It has the right mix of learning and Islam.
              </ul>
